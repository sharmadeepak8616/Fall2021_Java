     * OOPS Concept
     *
     * 1. Encapsulation
     *      Wrapping up the code in a single unit (eg: Class)
     *      To implement Encapsulation concept, we create Class and write code in it.
     *
     * 2. Abstraction:
     *      Hiding unnecessary information from user
     *      To implement Abstraction, by creating methods.
     *
     * 3. Inheritance
     *      -> To implement Inheritance, we create parent-child relationship between two classes.
     *      -> childClass can access parentClass methods/variables (except private methods/variables)
     *      -> we use "extends" keyword with childClass to achieve Inheritance
     *      -> a class can extend ONLY one class (why? - Diamond Problem)
     *
     *
     *
     *
     * 4. Polymorphism
     *
